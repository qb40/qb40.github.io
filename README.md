## My Story

I first got into computer programming with LOGO in the 4th class. However, I take interest in programming when I learn about the `IF` command in GWBASIC - the idea that computers are decision making machines! I took to learn BASIC in great detail - and eventually bump into graphics in GWBASIC itself. From Debashish, I pick up QuickBASIC 4.0, a brilliant programming environment by Microsoft. On the HP-Compaq desktop computer my father bought (with 256MB RAM and Windows XP installed), or the IBM Thinkpad laptop my father brought home after completing lab experiments, I pour in a lot of time on learning QuickBASIC and writing text/graphics mode DOS programs. My text mode programs include [Playing any file as a sound (frequency steps)](https://github.com/qb40/file-sound), designing a [4-bit Huffman coding based file packer](https://github.com/qb40/file-pack), performing [Particle gravity simulation with velocity colored traces](https://github.com/qb40/gravity-simulation), a simple [Single tone sound creator](https://github.com/qb40/sound-creator), [Reading the bytes of a file one-by-one](https://github.com/qb40/file-bytes), viewing the [byte values of a file as a line graph](https://github.com/qb40/file-graph), finding the [Byte sum of a file to verify its integrity](https://github.com/qb40/file-byte-sum), writing a tool for [Encrypting and decrypting a file](https://github.com/qb40/file-encrypt), a tool for helping [Find and verify IO ports](https://github.com/qb40/port-io-helper), another tool to determine the [Keyboard scancode of a key](https://github.com/qb40/keyboard-scancode), one for [Making a text-mode user interface or art](https://github.com/qb40/text-draw), a tool for finding basic [System information](https://github.com/qb40/system-information), a tiny [ASCII-art based chocolate info program](https://github.com/qb40/chocolate-info), and the classic [Stone paper scissor game vs the CPU](https://github.com/qb40/stone-paper-scissor).

QuickBASIC‚Äôs `SCREEN 13` VGA graphics mode is an 8-bit pixel (256 colors using palette) mode with `320x200` screen resolution. One can draw a pixel here by simply writing values to the `0xA000` memory address (text mode is also similar, but speed is not an issue there). In this mode, I experiment with [3d formulae](https://github.com/qb40/3d-experiment), use [Left or right mouse button to draw](https://github.com/qb40/fun-with-mouse), design a small and simple [Animation showing rising building like structures](https://github.com/qb40/building-animation), a basic [Bouncing ball animation](https://github.com/qb40/ball-animation), demonstrate [50 different graphics animations](https://github.com/qb40/designs), develop a [640x400 Picture creator tool](https://github.com/qb40/picture-creator), and another to [Add an animated effect to an image](https://github.com/qb40/image-effect). I first learn assembly language with `DEBUG32`, a command-line assembler and disassembler, and then move to `MASM` and `FASM` - I use these to write fast routines to draw to screen or perform mouse handling with Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), with reference from Ralf Brown‚Äôs Interrupt list. I also write a [Bootloader that shows the values of CPU registers](https://github.com/qb40/boot-register-view) - which I tested using Bochs, a portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator. Do these remind you of the Windows XP days? You can [download its theme](https://github.com/themepackf/windows-xp) if you like.
